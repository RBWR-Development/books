Turbine control in Unit #2 has been reworked to include a synchroscope, which makes it much more realistic. Now, not only do you have to maintain it very close to 3600 RPM to synchronize it, but you also need to keep the synchroscope in phase, which means keeping the needle close to the top indication. The synchroscope doesn't really matter at lower turbine speeds, as it just rotates randomly. However, once you are close to 3600 RPM, it will rotate in a specific direction: counterclockwise below 3600 RPM and clockwise above that figure. In order to synchronize, you will need to get close to 3600 RPM but stay a few RPM away from this value and keep it there until the synchroscope points up. Then, you can press the sync switch to synchronize with the network. For more precise operations around 3600 RPM, an additional precision valve was added. It works the same way as the turbine valve but in smaller increments.

Also, indicators for turbine vibration and differential expansion were added. At this moment, high vibrations can trip the turbine, while differential expansion has no influence on the operations. Vibrations depend mostly on turbine acceleration and several resonance frequencies. Please refer to the next point on the turbine startup procedure.
