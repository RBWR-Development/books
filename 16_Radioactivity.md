# Radioactivity

Radioactivity is simulated in the game, and you can become contaminated as a player. At this moment, there is no penalty for that, but this will be reworked in the future. There are several devices available to measure radioactivity.

* Personal Geiger counter: It will provide an instant value of radioactivity in the vicinity, measured in microsieverts per hour. This device can also be used on other players to check if they are not contaminated.
* Contamination detectors: They are placed in the airlock, and players should perform a quick scan every time they exit the turbine hall or enter it.
* Personal dosimeter: This device is based on a film that darkens as it absorbs radiation. It measures the total radiation exposure that the player has received. It is scaled in millisieverts, but for gameplay purposes, the effect has been enhanced.
* Showers: They will reduce your current radioactivity, but they cannot reduce your total exposure. What you have already been exposed to has already caused the damage.
