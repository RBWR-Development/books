# Introduction

Welcome to the Realistic Boiling Water Reactor simulator.

If you are new to this experience, please go to Unit #1. It is here as a learning environment. You can access the interactive startup guide and also enable descriptions of the handles (check the wheel button on the right side of the screen). Once you are comfortable running the reactor in Unit #1, you can switch to Unit #2, which is essentially the same model but in a better-looking environment. Unit #2 has some special features, like the synchroscope and an advanced startup procedure, but you should be able to figure out the differences yourself.

As for the simulation, my aim was to make this experience as realistic as possible, with very clear indicators and switches. This is not a simulator aimed at blowing up the reactor (there are many such experiences available if that's what you seek). My goal was to create an experience that will teach you the basics of reactor operations and provide some fun along the way. Therefore, it is high in quality, but, of course, not in quantity. In a real plant, every system will have many more subsystems and switches to achieve the same objectives.

Please read this manual carefully to fully understand BWR operations before you begin. This experience is best enjoyed in cooperation with 3 to 4 players. A single player can manage this simulation with the use of automatic systems, but please be aware that you will earn fewer points this way. Please join our Discord with any questions, ideas, and complaints.
