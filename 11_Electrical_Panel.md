# Electrical Panel

The electrical panel connects all the important devices in the plant. The system consists of several buses that can be connected to each other via transformers. Generally, electricity flows from top to bottom.

The top line represents the offsite power source. Initially, it will be connected to Main Bus A via the startup transformer and the switch on the right. This bus supplies power to all the important pumps needed for startup. Only one pump out of every two is available, as the others are connected to Bus B (although both reactor circulation pumps are available from Bus A). Please be cautious not to overload the transformer during startup or a turbine trip, as it has limited power capacity. Once synchronized with the network, Buses A and B can be connected directly to the turbine generator using switches on the bottom of the vertical panel (*in U2 switches on the left*), allowing for maximum plant power output.

On the bottom panel, there is a Safety Bus that is connected to Bus A. It supplies power to safety equipment and other low-power devices. In case of an emergency, this bus can be powered by diesel generators; however, they must be started first. This bus also provides power to the Emergency Bus, charges batteries that can supply power to the Emergency Bus (located on the left side of the panel), and can also power the DC bus (located in the lower part of the panel).

The Emergency Bus is continuously powered thanks to the batteries, ensuring that emergency lights and panel controls are never lost. The DC bus, which supplies power to the Control Room Lights and Ventilation system, can be powered either from the Safety Bus under normal circumstances or from the Emergency Bus if necessary. This bus not only provides lighting in the Control Room but also ignition for the Diesel Generators.

Standard Procedures:
- Turbine Trip: If power was drawn from the Turbine, switch back to offsite power using the switch on the top-right side of the panel. Reactor power will automatically be reduced to 10%, as you will have only half of the pumps available on the startup transformer. If the startup transformer cannot sustain the load, the reactor must be tripped and cooled using the Reactor Core Isolation procedure.
- Lack of Offsite Power: In this case, the turbine will trip, and the reactor must be SCRAMed and cooled by the Reactor Core Isolation procedure because no power will be available to the main pumps. The DC Panel should be connected to the Emergency Panel. Once initially cooled, Diesel Generators should be started with ignition power from the DC Panel. Once the diesel generators are online, they can provide power to the Safety Bus, which powers the offline pumps for further cooling.
