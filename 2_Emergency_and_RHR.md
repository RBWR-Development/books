Leftmost panel consists of two emergency and one heat removal system:
- RCIC
- LPCI
- RHR

RCIC (Reactor Core Isolation Cooling) consists of steam driven feedwater turbine and steam relief. This system isolates the whole cooling circuit providing independent feedwater from the suppression pool. RCIC is mainly used in a situation where no power is available as it doesn't require any power to be operated (mainly offsite power loss event) or during a LOCA (Loss Of Coolant Accident) in the primary system. Enabling RCIC will cause reactor SCRAM and later turbine inlet valve should be setup to provide sufficent feedwater to keep reactor water level at desired limit.

LPCI (Low Pressure Coolant Injection) is a part of the RHR system (see later) which provides large amounts of feedwater when needed although under certain condition: reactor pressure must be below 3000 kPa and Safety Bus must be powered either from the Main Bus or by EDG (Emergency Diesel Generator). Enabling LPCI will scram the reactor.

RHR (Residual Heat Removal) consists of two pumps (Shutdwon Cooling Pumps) and is used to cool down the reactor during shutdown scenarios. During the cooling phase both pumps should be used, while at shutdown only one should be sufficient although this might depend on the amount of resudial heat (residual heat is strongest shortly after shutdown and weakens over time).
