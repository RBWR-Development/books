Please be advised the manual is being reworked to update it with the rework of U1 control room.

Welcome to the Realistic Boiling Water Reactor simulator.

If you are new to this experience, you will want to learn Unit #1 first. This unit is simpler and can be run alone. It is highly recommended that you start on a private server. Under the gear icon on the right there is an interactive startup guide which will teach you how to run the reactor in automatic mode. It is also advisable that you at least review this whole manual and also refer to checklists which can be found in the control rooms.  *All texts placed in italics will refer to Unit #2 operations* and can be ignored at first.

Realistic Boiling Water Reactor simulator aims at realistic simulation of nuclear power plant operations although simplified a lot to allow for easy learning and challenging cooperative gameplay. We are currently developing much more complex simulators (Covebay, Dunscom) but even when released RBWR should be picked first as a main tool to understand the basics without getting too much into details.

Summarizing RBWR simulates real life principles of operating the plant in general although not in every little details that we didn't find important. Also, RBWR doesn't have any meltdown or explosion animations. This experience aims at operating the plant properly.
