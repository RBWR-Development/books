Operations of Unit #2

Unit #2 hosts the same type of reactor as Unit #1, so the operations are pretty similar. However, there are several differences. Unit #2 is still under development, while Unit #1 remains mostly a learning environment and a more relaxed experience.

Please read this part of the guide to learn about the main differences in operating Unit #2. It is strongly advised that you become comfortable with Unit #1 before switching to Unit #2, as, by their nature, the indicators are less readable, and some of them are not present at all.

In Unit #2, many of the automatic systems can be enabled at all times, and many of them won't disable automatically. You have to pay a lot of attention to whether the actual automatic system can operate in a given regime. For example, enabling condenser auto control when there is no steam flow will result in opening the flow to the maximum, which can later induce a problem with severe under pressure. Use your knowledge of how everything works from what you have learned in Unit #1.
