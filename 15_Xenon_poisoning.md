Iodine-135 and Xenon-135 are important elements in managing reactor power.

Iodine-135 is a direct product of nuclear fission. It will be produced in proportion to reactor thermal power. The indicator is scaled so that the % of Iodine-135 concentration strictly corresponds to the % of reactor thermal power. Therefore, if the power is above the concentration, it will rise, and if it is below, it will drop as Iodine-135 decays into Xenon-135. The latter element is very important because it is a strong neutron absorber. Therefore, high levels of Xenon-135 will poison the reactor, making it much harder to reach critical levels. The higher the Iodine-135 level, quicker the Xenon-135 level will rise. Therefore, when shutting down the reactor from full power, with a lot of Iodine-135 produced in the core, the Xenon-135 level can rise very quickly, making it difficult to restart the reactor (especially with low fuel levels).

On the other hand, Xenon-135 will decay over time, so after a shutdown, operators might need to wait some time until Xenon-135 concentration drops. Xenon-135 can also be destroyed by high neutron flux, causing it to decrease rapidly at high reactor power settings. You can experiment a bit and observe how the concentrations change. Reducing power will always increase Xenon-135 levels, causing the power to drop even further. Conversely, increasing the power will accelerate Xenon-135 decay, leading to an even greater increase in power. This positive reactivity coefficient can be dangerous if not supervised correctly. Due to negative void and temperature coefficients, the reactor will stabilize itself around a certain power level. Unfortunately, due to Xenon, you will have to constantly adjust reactor power until a balance is achieved between Xenon production and decay. Reactor power will generally increase at higher power settings and decrease at lower power settings.

In reality, the half-life times of both elements are 6 hours for Iodine-135 and 9 hours for Xenon-135, but for the sake of simulation, these times have been shortened several times. Nevertheless, it's not an overly rapid process, and you will have plenty of time to react. Just remember that after a new power setting, even if the reactor is in perfectly stable condition, it will change with time and will require some small adjustments.
